1- for this budget i can make 2 music tracks, 1 for the menu and 1 for the gameplay + 25/30 sfx

2- my hourly rate is 25$ but of course if you will need more stuff we can easily work on a fixed price

3- Yes of course, all the stuff i make is totally original and the rights will be yours

4- I usually make original sfx too, that means you will have the rights on the sfx too

5- All the stuff i will produce for you will be totally yours, and you can use them as you want, i won't have any rights on them

6- As you prefer

7- I usually make previews of the music, the client gives me a feedback and then i develop what he/she likes; the same with sound fx

i forgot to tell you that my price includes any revision you need to be 110% satisfied about the work
