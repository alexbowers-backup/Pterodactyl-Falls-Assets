Interview Answers
--------------------------------------

1. Okay, your budget has been noted.

2. My usual rate for composition is $100 for every minute of composition. For sound effects, I charge $20 per sound effect. The composition may be a choice of being looped or just continuous. 

3. Yes. You will own rights to the song.

4b. All music that I will use will be created by myself from scratch. I do not use loops in my compositions for originality.

5. To be honest, I am more of a BGM man that a sound effects man, so for this reason, I am not very good in sound effects. I will, however, look for royalty-free sounds to avoid issues. I will also edit the sound and tweak it a little bit so it sounds uniform with the other sound effects.

6. Yes, I can provide the raw files.

7. My usual workflow for compositions is that I give a 30 second draft first, to see if you approve of the feel of the background music. If you approve, then I will continue to finish the whole duration of the song.
