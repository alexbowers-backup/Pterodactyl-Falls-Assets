Interview Answers
--------------------------------------

1. I can provide all of the things you listed in the job description including up to 3 background music tracks and all of the sound effects that you listed for my original proposal of $277.78. However, I would also be willing to work for an hourly rate of $18 per hour with a cutoff of $277.78 and provide everything for a maximum of that price or less if I am able to complete the project in a shorter amount of time.

2. My usual rate is between $18 - $20 per hour depending on the complexity of the job.

3. You will have full rights to do whatever you wish with all audio that I provide you after payment has been made.

4. All sounds I deliver are absolutely 100% legal to use. I have a sound library which I manipulate to create unique and original sounds specifically to fit your project. I also create original sounds from scratch. Either way, everything I provide will be perfectly legal for you to use.

5. I don't usually provide a license or any kind of written agreement for clients. The work I provide is yours to use however you please. However, I would certainly be willing to sign an agreement which would officially give you rights to use all original sounds that I produce if you wish to take such a course of action.

6. I can absolutely provide raw high quality WAV files of all sounds.

7. I try to keep my clients as updated as possible. With any job I deliver samples of my work after every major progress point or alteration has been made and more frequent updates at your request. This way we stay on the same page and I am able to realize your vision and deliver the most suitable work I possibly can.
