1. For $550 I can write a one minute music track and design up to 30 sound effects. 

2. My usual rates are $150 to $200 per minute of music and $10 to $20 per sound effect, all depending on complexity. You'll notice that I made you a package deal for $550, as you seem to have a lot of games needing audio and I like to work with long-term clients. I can provide similar deals if we continue working together after this project is completed.

3. Yes, all copyright will be transferred to you. I will keep the rights to use the work in my portfolio once you launch the game.

4. I use a mix of library sounds (100% legally purchased as royalty-free) and sounds that I record or design myself.

5. All the deliverables will be provided as royalty-free, so I will not need to be compensated once you pay what was agreed upon.

6. I can only provide the final files.

7. My rates include 2 rows of revisions. I will provide a first batch of sounds that you can implement and test, and then we can discuss any changes you might want.
