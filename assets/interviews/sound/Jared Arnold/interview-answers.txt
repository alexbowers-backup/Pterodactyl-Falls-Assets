Interview Answers
--------------------------------------

1. All of the sound effects you need (I'm imagining that's ~30) + 3 looping musical tracks of 60-90sec to cover different levels. We can negotiate about this; tell me what you want ideally in terms of sound, and I'll tell you how much, if at all, I'd have to scale things down to fit it within the budget.

2. My standard rate for this work (music composition+production and sound design) is $50/hour. If it's for longer term work, I can go a little lower.

3. Yes.

4a+b. Anything that I use that I didn't create directly is from a library I legally own. I'm never just dropping in existing sounds directly, but I will use library sounds layered in or as a starting point for further processing. I'm also happy to work on sounds entirely from scratch. But naturally, to do this I have to add a little more to the cost. (E.g., if you need an ocean sound and I have to go record it, I have to factor that into the cost.)

5. Yes.

6. What do you mean by the raw files? My standard practice is simply to deliver the finished sounds, but if there's something else you're looking for, let me know and I can probably provide it as well.

7. For sounds, I usually try to get something pretty close, then send it over for feedback. If it's on the right track, I then make final tweaks. If not, I go back and incorporate your revisions or start fresh. But in general, I don't do more than a couple rounds of revisions for sounds, as it usually gets close to what's needed quickly. Music can involve a little more back-and-forth, say 3 rounds of revision.
