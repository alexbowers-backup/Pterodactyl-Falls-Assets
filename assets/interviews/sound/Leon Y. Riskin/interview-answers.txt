Interview Answers

1. Considering the current budget, you'll get the following, based on my previous works on similar games:

- 30sec menu loop
- 60-90sec gameplay loop
- up to 50 custom sfx 
The music will be composed from scratch and you will receive an exclusive license document (buyout)

2. My usual rate is 350$ for a 60-90sec loop and sound design rates vary depending on the amount of sfx. My hourly rate is 40$/h.

3-4 - The sound effects are usually a combination of custom recordings and my in-house sound effects library. For example, wings flap can be recorded locally with an umbrella or a bed sheet and some crashing sound can be a combination of an explosion effect from my library with a custom recording of falling objects. 

5. You will get an exclusive license for the music and the sfx can be used royalty free

6. Considering the music, by "raw" sounds you mean early drafts or stems? 
Either way, you can have both, if needed. Regarding the SFX I usually create few options for each instance for you to choose from. 

7. I usually create first drafts for the music and sfx and then revise anything that needs to be reworked. First drafts can take 3-7 days and revisions are usually posted within 24 hours.
