1- The normal charge I apply to music composition is 100€/30sec, so, if the song will be of 1min, the charge will be 200€ as well as for 2 songs of 30sec each. For the sound effects and sound design, 30€ each. So I think that we could stay on budget (500€)

2- My usual rates are, for finished and polished music 100€/30sec, 30€ every single sound effect.

3- The charges applied are made in relation to the fact that I will own all the copyright.

4- The sounds will be composed using sounds library banks (as strings samples, etc)

5- I will grant you to limited use of the work to be used only in your game and nowhere else.

6- I will provide the finished pieces

7- I will provide you everything you need, following the specifications you will give me. Than, I'll submit the work, thank i will fix it with your feedback (2 fixes included in charges).
