1. The budget seems absolutely fine for a small to medium sized mobile game which is usually 1-2 music loops and 20 - 30 sfx. Though i do not have any detailed specs. Sometimes client asks for more than 2 music loops etc so generally we're most accurate seing the audio list.


2. My usual rates are $100/ min of music, $7-$10 /sfx depending of complexity of sounds. Though it can be negotiable with bigger amount of work.


3. You will have all the copyrights

4/5 All sounds are either from sound library or custom created by myself. And all legally purchased.

6. I will send you the final sounds, not raw audio that was used to create them. The sounds cannot be used or resell as royalty free sounds (this is part of licensing of every commercial sound library). But you can modify the final sounds as you like within this particular project for making i.e sounds for part 2 of the game, new characters, levels etc... And also other projects that are yours

7. When i have all the specs, refs and descriptions i make the sounds based on this then you assess and ask for revisions if needed. As for the music i will send you first draft, if u like it i will finish it, if u don'tike the sketch i'll make another. Once the first draft is approved i can then make minor revisions to it free of charge if after approving the first draft you change your mind completely, i can make another but then it will be agreed as a completely new piece 

I will provide final sound effects in any audio rate you prefer
