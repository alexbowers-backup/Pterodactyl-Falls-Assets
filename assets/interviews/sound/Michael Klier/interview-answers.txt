1. This budget will get you the SFX covered and 1-2 music loops (maybe 3, it's hard to estimate without a asset list or some more concrete numbers of the required assets) 

2. I usually try to work with flat fees that I figure out with my clients based on their needs/budget. If you however prefer to pay on a per sound basis: My rates for single SFX are between 10-25$ (depending on complexity). For Music it's 100-300$ per minute if I get to keep the rights, the rates go up if you want to own the rights exclusively (depending on style/genre/complexity).

3. For the SFX yes, for the music we have to talk about it. Either I grant you rights to use it for your project and everything that's involved (web, media, trailers, etc.) and I retain the rights as author/creator or we agree on a full license buy-out.

4a/b. Yes, they're either sourced from one of my 3rd party libraries or created by myself.

5. Yes. 

6. You will receive the rights to use the final sounds to use in your project. I won't receive any project files, but I grant unlimited revisions (if the communication is good).

7. Workflow: We agree on a complete asset lists of required sounds first. Based on that I will ask a couple of questions and maybe ask for some references to get a good idea of what you want the sounds to "sound like". Then I'll create sounds and send them to you for feedback/criticism. If a sound needs to be changed based on your feedback I'll do another pass. If you're not satisfied after a 3rd pass I will request references or additional directions. Once all sounds are finished I will do one final mastering pass over all assets if needed.

Regarding the rights I would like to setup a contract that covers all of these points in detail.

Typo: 6. You won't receive any project files.
